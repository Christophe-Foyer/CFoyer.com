# Tortuga Agtech ML Infrastructure

Leading the machine learning infrastructure at Tortuga Agtech, I designed and implemented scalable ML systems for robotic crop harvesting.

## Key Achievements

- **Infrastructure Design**: Led the complete infrastructure design for ML systems from model training to deployment
- **Team Leadership**: Mentored junior engineers and managed labeling team priorities
- **Pipeline Optimization**: Optimized training pipeline with hyperparameter optimization and distributed training while maintaining backward compatibility
- **Cost Reduction**: Migrated labeling workflows to new providers and CVAT, reducing costs by over 50%

## Technologies Used

- Python & PyTorch for ML model development
- Docker for containerization
- AWS for cloud infrastructure
- ROS for robotics integration
- Computer vision libraries (OpenCV, etc.)

## Impact

The ML infrastructure improvements enabled the company to scale their robotic harvesting operations and significantly reduce operational costs while improving model performance and deployment speed.
