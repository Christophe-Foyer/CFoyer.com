# MLOps Pipeline Overhaul

Comprehensive overhaul of MLOps pipelines for automated model training and evaluation across multiple ML projects at Oishii.

## Project Overview

Redesigned the entire MLOps workflow to support automated model training, evaluation, and deployment with proper versioning and monitoring.

## Key Features

- **Automated Training**: Set up automated model training pipelines with configurable hyperparameters
- **Model Evaluation**: Implemented comprehensive evaluation metrics and automated testing
- **Version Control**: Added proper model versioning and experiment tracking
- **Monitoring**: Real-time monitoring of model performance in production

## Technical Stack

- Airflow for workflow orchestration
- PyTorch Lightning for training
- Ray for distributed computing
- MLflow for experiment tracking
- Docker for containerization

## Results

- 50% reduction in model training time
- Improved model reliability and performance tracking
- Streamlined deployment process
- Better collaboration between ML team members
