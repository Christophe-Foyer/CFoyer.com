# About Me

Hi, I'm Christophe! I'm a Machine Learning and Computer Vision Engineer with a passion for building intelligent systems that solve real-world problems. Currently working as an ML Consultant, I specialize in developing robust ML pipelines and computer vision solutions for robotics.

## What I Do

I bridge the gap between cutting-edge machine learning research and practical, production-ready systems. My expertise spans the entire ML lifecycle - from data collection and model training to deployment and monitoring in production environments.

## My Journey

With dual French and US citizenship and settled status in the UK, I've had the privilege of working across different continents and cultures. This global perspective has shaped my approach to problem-solving and collaboration.

When I'm not coding or training models, you can find me exploring new technologies, contributing to open-source projects, or enjoying the great outdoors.
